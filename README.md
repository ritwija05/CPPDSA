# CPPDSA
Hey there! Welcome to my personal CPPDSA (C++ Data Structures and Algorithms) repository. I created this repository to track my progress and ensure accountability as I delve into the world of data structures and algorithms using C++.

# Contents
Within this repository, you will find the following directories:

 **Data Structures**: I have implemented various data structures in C++, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more. Each data structure is implemented as a C++ class, providing essential operations and functionalities.

**Algorithms**: In this directory, you'll find my implementations of important algorithms using C++. These include sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and more. These algorithms are implemented as C++ functions and can be utilized to solve a wide range of computational problems efficiently.


# Accountability
To hold myself accountable and make steady progress, I have taken up two comprehensive DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) study sheets:

1.**Striver's A2Z DSA Course**: I am following [Striver's A2Z DSA Course](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)
t. It provides a structured approach to learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. I refer to this sheet to strengthen my understanding and reinforce concepts.

2.**Arsh Goyal's DSA Sheet**: Additionally, I am also following [Arsh Goyal's DSA Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r35qSXY6rSAonFbPEKB_KXUvpCIBbVGMp5001MaNb3c/edit#gid=0)
 for further practice and to broaden my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. This sheet covers various topics and helps me in expanding my problem-solving skills.

By diligently studying and practicing the concepts outlined in these study sheets, I aim to improve my proficiency in data structures and algorithms.
